# Amazfit Helio Strap vs Whoop 5.0
This repository contains the methodology and comparison logic used to compare data from the Amazfit Helio Strap with that from Whoop using exports from the two respective platforms, Zepp and Whoop, remapping, aggregating, and enriching with the series obtained from Apple Health.

Below is the complete list and functional explanation of the variables considered for comparison:

 
### **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**

**What it is**: the variability of the intervals between heartbeats.

**Why it is important**:
- It is one of the best indicators of the state of the **autonomic nervous system**.
- A high HRV â†’ indicates that you are rested, adaptable, and ready to cope with stress or training.
- A low HRV â†’ indicates fatigue, stress, and lack of recovery.

**Insight**: it helps you understand whether your body is recovering or overloaded.

### **RHR (Resting Heart Rate)**

**What it is**: your beats per minute when you are completely at rest.

**Why it matters**:
- A lower RHR over time is a sign of good cardiovascular fitness.
- A higher than usual RHR â†’ may indicate stress, fatigue, or that you are fighting an infection.

**Insight**: it is a quick and easy signal to understand the overall state of the body.

### **Sleep**

**What it is**: the quantity and quality of your night's rest (REM cycles, deep sleep, latency, efficiency).

**Why it matters**:
- Sleep is the body and brain's **primary recovery tool**.
- Without adequate sleep, HRV decreases, RHR increases, and performance capacity worsens.

**Insight**: Whoop uses sleep to calculate how ready you are to sustain effort.

### **Heart Rate During Workout**

**What it is**: heart rate trend during exercise and exertion.

**Why it is important**:
- It allows you to estimate the **cardiovascular** and metabolic load of each session.
- It is used to calculate **Strain** (how much physical stress you have accumulated).

**Insight**: it helps you understand if the level of exertion is in line with your recovery.

### **Respiration Rate**

**What it is**: the number of breaths per minute, especially during sleep.
    
**Why it is important**:
  - It is a very stable parameter: variations can indicate stress, illness, or respiratory problems.
  - Monitored at night, it gives early warning signs of infections (e.g., fever, flu, COVID).
        
**Insight**: used as an early warning sign for health problems or fatigue.

### **ðŸ”‘ Why is this key data?**
  
Because it **covers the three pillars of performance and recovery**:
1. **Physiological recovery** â†’ HRV + RHR
2. **Rest and regeneration** â†’ Sleep
3. **Training load** â†’ HR during workout
4. **Overall health** â†’ Breathing rate
